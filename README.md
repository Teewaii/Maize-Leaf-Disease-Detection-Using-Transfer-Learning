# Maize-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Using-Transfer-Learning
The aim of this study is to implement, evaluate, and compare the performance of different pre-trained models (via transfer learning) and a custom CNN model in detecting and classifying maize leaf diseases.

<h3>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES:</h3>
The aim of this study is to implement, evaluate, and compare the performance of different pre-trained models (via transfer learning) and a custom CNN model in detecting and classifying maize leaf diseases.

<h2>The objectives to the aim are as follows;</h2>

<p>a.	Implement and fine-tune VGG19, ResNet152V2, Inception V3, and a custom CNN 	model for maize leaf disease detection.</p>
<p>b.	Evaluate the performance of each model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, 	and confusion matrix.</p>
<p>c.	Compare the efficiency and effectiveness of the pre-trained models against the custom 	CNN model to determine the most suitable model for the specific task.</p>
<p>e.	Utilize established frameworks and libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) to implement the pre-trained models.</p>
